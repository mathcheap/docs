## What is Mathcheap?

Mathcheap is an AI-powered application for converting images to LaTeX and editing LaTeX with ease.


## Motivation

Many popular math OCR solutions require complex login workflows, limited free usage quotas, and closed ecosystems. This creates substantial barriers for students, researchers, and developers who need a self-hosting, privacy-focused, and accessible tool for converting images into LaTeX or Typst. **Mathcheap aims to solve these these problems.**
