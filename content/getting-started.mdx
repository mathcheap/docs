## Quick Start

You can start using Mathcheap immediately without any installation.

1. **Visit the Website**

   Go to [https://mathcheap.xyz](https://mathcheap.xyz).

2. **Upload an Image**

   You have three ways to input an image:
   - **Click** the upload area to select a file from your device.
   - **Drag and drop** an image file into the box.
   - **Paste** an image directly from your clipboard using `Ctrl+V` (Windows) or `Cmd+V` (Mac).

   > **Note:** Supported formats are PNG, JPG, and WEBP. The maximum file size is 2MB.

3. **Get LaTeX**

   Once uploaded, the AI will process the image and generate the LaTeX code for you. You can then copy this code into your LaTeX editor (like Overleaf, Typst, or Markdown).
